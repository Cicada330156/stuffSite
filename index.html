			<h2>Iraqi Invasion</h2>
			<p>Kuwait is a small country on the Persian gulf, between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Similarly to its neighbors, the country is rich in oil, and it today boasts one of the hight-valued currencies in the world. Leading up to the 1990’s, Iraq borrowed about 14 billion USD worth from Kuwait to fund its war with Iran. Then, in 1990, Iraq accused Kuwait of overdrawing oil over the OPEC-imposed limits. Some of this oil was allegedly also stolen from an oil field which spanned the Iran-Kuwait border.</p>
			<p>On August 2, 1990, with the goal of cancelling its debt to Kuwait, gaining power in the region, and increasing its available oil, Iraq invaded Kuwait. Its armored division started the assault, and within 14 to 36 hours, Kuwait had fallen under Iraqi control. The most Kuwaiti casualties occurred during those first 14 hours, with approximately 4,200 deaths. Shortly thereafter a provisional government was established, under the supervision of a cousin of Iraq’s then-ruler Saddam Hussein.</p>
			<h2>Response and the Beginning of U.S. Involvement</h2>
			<p>Four days after the initial invasion, the UNSC (United Nations Security Council) passed a resolution banning all trade with Iraq, which affected all UN members. On the 7th, U.S. troops were sent to Saudi Arabia. This was done under Saudi Arabia’s and its ruler King Fahd’s own invitation, as there was a fear that it was Iraq’s next target, which would put 40% of the oil supply under Iraq’s control. While Iraq never did end up attacking Saudi Arabia, it still acted as a vital staging ground for later coalition forces, and the increased foreign forces’ presence may have been an important deterrent. This and the soon-to-follow increase of forces in the region were dubbed Operation Desert Shield for their protective role to the region.</p>
			<p>On November 29, the UNSC issued a sanction of the use of force if Iraq's occupation of Kuwait was still in effect on January 15, 1991. In response, the United States began organizing a coalition of nations, primarily composed of Arab forces, but also including assistance from Canada, Britain, and others. On January 12 of 1991, the U.S. House and Senate approved the same use of force at the request of U.S. president George H. W. Bush.</p>

			</div>
			
			<h2>Desert Storm</h2>
			<p>Operation Desert Storm had a goal of wearing down Iraqi forces and making it safer for ground forces to advance. In fact, after Desert Storm had been in effect for almost a month and a half until February 24, 1991, the next phase - codenamed Desert Sabre - took only about four days to wipe out any meaningful Iraqi military presence in the region. Desert storm consisted of two primary parts.</p>
			<p>Possibly the most recognized portion of Desert Storm was the coalition air operations. These began with stripes on Iraqi radar sites to allow non-stealth planes to safely enter Iraqi airspace. Among the first targets are communications infrastructure, mobile SCUD missile (surface-to-surface) launch sites, SAM (surface-to-air) missile sites, and facilities related to chemical and biological weapons. The SAM sites are targeted by “wild weasel” duos - one fighter which acts as bait, so the SAM sight will obtain a radar lock, then a second fighter carrying anti-radiation missiles - missiles which will track the radar waves and target their source. The SCUD sights are tracked and targeted by droves, due to their numbers, low detectability, and to protect Saudi Arabia and the largely defenseless Israel. Israel was strongly pressured by the United States to refrain from directly retaliating against SCUD attacks, although they were provided with some generally ineffective missile defense systems. Had Iraq succeeded in tempting Israel into direct conflict, the coalition ran the risk of dissolving, due to its primarily Arab makeup.</p>
			<p>The other, similarly very important portion of desert storm was the coalition naval aspect. Once the Iraqi mines were largely cleared, and the Iraqi and captured Kuwaiti forces were destroyed - the last was sunk by February 11 - , the coalition (primarily U.S.) naval forces did three things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>provided a base for air operations from the aircraft carriers</li>
				<li>launched, especially tomahawk, missile attacks on Iraqi targets in Kuwait, in addition to shelling the forces there</li>
				<li>threatened amphibious attacks by marines, tying up six Iraqi divisions defending the coast</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Desert Sabre</h2>
			<p>On February 24, 1991, Operation Desert Sabre began. 100 hours later on February 28, Iraq accepted a cease-fire and began the process of the conflict’s resolution. Desert Sabre consisted of two arms: one reached around the west side of Kuwait to cut off the Iraqi forces there, while the other moved straight north into the armored divisions stationed on Kuwait’s southern border. Soon, on the 26th, Iraqi forces began an armed retreat from Kuwait along the 6-lane Highway 80. Coalition forces bombed the front and back of this convoy to entrap the vehicles in between, then continued to attack, disabling many military and looted civilian vehicles. The initial damage reports portrayed a slaughter, which prompted the U.S. government to push for a ceasefire resolution to the conflict.</p>

			</div>
			
			<h2>Resolution</h2>
			<p>In talks after the conclusion of the Gulf War, the UN required Iraq give up any and all of its weapons of mass destruction, including biological and chemical as well as nuclear. Iraq, however, did not comply with inspections. In addition, Iraq brutally suppressed an internal rebellion, to the extent that the allied coalition members established no-fly zones over that area. The United States kept forces in the area to enforce these zones, but these were independent of the war.</p>
			<h2>Importance</h2>
			<p>
				The Gulf War was important for the United States for several reasons. It was the first major intervention in world affairs since the Vietnam war, a war notorious for its immense toll on the American people, and its resulting unpopularity. The Gulf War, however, sought to defend against the idea of “mission creep” - the idea that an original goal may expand over time to become unnecessary and/or harmful. This was combatted by engaging in the conflict under the Powell Doctrine:
				<ol>
					<li>the conflict had broad support from the American public, and</li>
					<li>the conflict had a clear set of goals, over which it would not step, instead staying constrained.</li>
				</ol>
				This second condition was remarkably well achieved, especially when set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, stopping offensive once Iraq had been successfully repelled from Kuwait. However, it may be debated whether the continued military presence in the region and later wars overstepped the original goal. This has links to the later “War on Terror” in the region as well.
